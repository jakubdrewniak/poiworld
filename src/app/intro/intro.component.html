        <p>So, what is poi? Originated with the MƒÅori people of New Zealand, is type of dance or a prop.
          First pairs of poi were just rocks with reed tether attached to it. 
          It has evolved to many versions depending of various styles of performance.
          Check some of them in videos below!

        <p>Most popular type of poi is fire poi- prop is usually a steel chain with handle
          and a braided kevlar head (yup, the same as material of bulletproof vests) ond the other side.
          The head is soaked with flammable liquid and lighted up.
